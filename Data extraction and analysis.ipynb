Whilst made tremendous progress understanding brain activity years, research hasn’t answer questions relating nature emotions experiences. History Beginning late nineteenth century, time psychological queries driven philosophical understanding mind, typically equated consciousness. result, analysis brain behavior naturally thought role consciousness behavioral management brain. Ancient Mayans propose sorted feeling degree consciousness, purpose, worldly association mankind. consciousness incorporates stimuli nature interior stimuli, Mayans trusted essential type existence, equipped evolution.

John Locke, early philosopher, consciousness, individuality, freelanced substances. detected reason consciousness stuck specific body mind, consciousness transferred body mind one. Karl Marx, early thinker, denies mind-body classification holds consciousness jeopardized material eventualities one’s settings. William James, American psychologist, differentiated consciousness stream – unbroken continuous shifts. main center lot analysis moved strictly note cable behaviors primary half twentieth century, analysis human consciousness grown staggeringly 1950s. Sigmund Freud’s psychoanalytic theory, believed levels awareness- preconscious, conscious, unconscious responsible one’s behavior thinking. believed mid divided parts- id, ego, superego. Id present birth, instinctual, operates pleasure principle. ego underseals reality logic develops id infancy. Finally, superego internalization society’s moral standards responsible guilt. Now, Id regarded unconscious, ego superego conscious preconscious. Freud constantly revised clinical qualities researches, however, didn’t conduct scientific experiments work heavily scrutinized, leaving questions unanswered. Sigmund Freud’s theory differed psychologists theories understandable easily conveyed people. Sigmund Freud’s work hypotheses helped people shape perspectives youth, character, memory, sexuality, therapy. However, theories subject considerable criticism life. Whilst John Locke William James practical approach mystery conducting experiments, Sigmund Freud didn’t provide evidence support claims. Brain Today, essential focal point consciousness research understanding consciousness implies biologically mentally. Issues interest include phenomena perception, blindsight, brainwaves sleep, altered states consciousness produced psychoactive drugs. greater part test assesses consciousness approaching human subjects verbal report encounters. However, confirm criticalness verbal reports, researchers contrast action brain —that is, search neural connections consciousness.

Higher brain areas viewed encouraging, prefrontal cortex, involved range high order functions. mainstream theory implicates examples brain waves creating conditions consciousness. Analysts record mind waves, drawings electrical movement inside cerebrum, electroencephalograph (EEG) placing electrodes scalp. types brain waves (alpha, beta, theta, delta) correspond mental state (relaxed, alert, lightly asleep, deeply asleep) Memory Episodic memory regarded form conscious memory. capacity consciously remember personally experienced events situations past. hippocampus located brain’s temporal lobe responsible type memory. Consciousness plays part important memory distinctions. distinction implicit explicit characteristics; explicit memory consciously implicit memory includes events conscious of. Furthermore, empirical findings suggest declarative memory related consciousness well; meaning retrieval formation memory connected awareness. Working memory operates/maintains consciously perceived information temporarily stores tampers information whilst working tasks. current ways testing information lacking essential aspects, including spatial resolution, temporal resolution, scope. Examples methods PET, fMRI, EEG, implanted electrodes, etc. PET fMRI temporal resolution problems, EEG well-known localizability difficulties, implanted electrodes whilst great temporal spatial resolution test set number neurons; is, restricted scope.
